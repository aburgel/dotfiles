# git commands

- Use Graphite cli for all git interactions
- If main is currently checked out, you can create a new branch and commit
  changes by using `gt create -m 'commit message goes here'`
- If you're on a branch and want to save changes, use `gt modify`. This will
  amend the current commit.
- You can create a new stack in the series by also using `gt create`
- Do not commit directly to or otherwise modify the main branch
